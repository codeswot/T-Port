<h3 id="app-based-hailing-and-fare-calculation">App-based Hailing and Fare Calculation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Users hail a tricycle through the app and set a destination.</li>
<li>The app, in conjunction with the tricycle, calculates the fare upon arrival.</li>
<li>Payment options include card transactions using the tricycle’s inbuilt POS terminal, transfers to the (Trans-Port) account, and cash payments stored in the tricycle’s inbuilt cash box.</li>
<li>The cash box verifies if the received cash matches the calculated fare.</li>

<li>A seat sensor detects passenger presence.</li>
<li>Predefined prices based on distance and other factors are in place for various locations around the city.</li>
<li>Fare information is visible to passengers, and the driver communicates the fare.</li>
<li>Prices are negotiable, and upon mutual agreement, the driver initiates the trip.</li>
<li>If passengers disembark for an extended period, the trip is canceled, and payment is requested.</li>
<li>Users with the app installed on their smartphones automatically sync with the trip.</li>
